CS456 Computer Networks Programming Assignment 3
Shortest Path Routing Algorithm

Project Description
################################################
The goal of this assignment is to implement the shortest path routing algorithm(OSPF), which could be used to emulate the routing functionality of a router in the network.
The router first sends an INIT packet to the network(aka. network emulator NSE). 
The NSE replies with the circuit database associated with that router, which contains the links that router are connected to as well as their cost.
From the information in the circuit database, the router initializes its topology database, finds its neighbors and sends a hello packet to each of them.
Upon receiving a hello message, a router replies with an LSPDU message, including all entries in its circuit database, which contains all the link it connects to and their cost.
Upon receiving a LSPDU message, a router uses the message to update its topology database, uses the topology database to construct a RIB(routing information base) using the Dijkstra Algorithm, 
and forwards the LSPDU to all neighbors except the original sender.

Executables and parameters
################################################
1. Files
router.cpp: entry to the router program
packets.cpp: definitions of packet structures, functions for sending and receiving packets, functions for constructing circuit_DB and topology_DB(using the received packets)
packets.h: the associated header file
utilities.cpp: functions for translating hostname to ip address and making udp socket
utilities.h: the associated header file
Emulator-linux386: the network emulator provided by the instructor
Makefile: used to compile the program from source code
ReadMe: this file

2. To compile .cpp files
type "make" in the project directory

3. To run the program
(On host1)To run the network emulator: nselinux386 <host2> <nse_port>
(On host2)To run a router: router <router_id> <host1> <nse_port> <router_port>

<host2>: router's network address
<nse_port>: emulator's UDP port number
<router_id>: an interger that represents the router id(unique for each router)
<host1>: emulator's network address
<router_port>: router's UDP port number
